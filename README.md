# trackLiz

Analysis code to quantify movement of lizards in an experimental thermal gradient. DeepLabCut (DLC) is used to detect key points on multiple lizards in a frame, the lizTemp.py script takes raw DLC detections as input, and outputs coordinates and corresponding temperatures per animal (including locomotion metrics).
